Teaching Schedule Visualizer for UBCO


WalkThrough
-----------

**Instructor Search Page**

At the top of the main page there a three link buttons (Browse, Search, Help) that
will redirect you to other helpful areas of the UBC Okanagan Website.

On the main instructor search page there are two options for searching a professor. First, 
the user can search by name using anywhere from one letter of the professor's name to their 
entire name. Or users can search by discipline, but the exact abbreviation of the discipline 
must be used. 

A list of professors will appear based one what the user has searched for. The information
included in the list is the professor's name, discipline, and UBCID. There is also
the check box on the left side labelled "Show" which once checked will output that
particular professor's schedule. 

If a user would like to search multiple professors, once 
the "Show" box has been checked, it will stay checked even if the user searches a
different name without clicking visualize or refreshing the window. 

There is also the 
option to check the force update box beside each professor's information. This button is 
useful as schedule information is stored locally, so by checking the "Force Update" box
users can ensure that they get the most recent schedule information for a particular 
professor.

A user can check up to five professors at a time and then click the visualize button
which will redirect them to the visual schedule for the professors they checked. 

**Weekly Schedule Page**

At the top of the page under the title there is a legend showing which color is designated
to which professor, as each professor gets a unique color for their events. 

There is a weekly calendar for Term 1 on top and Term 2 underneath that. Each calendar
goes from Sunday to Saturday and 8AM to 9PM (the school hours). 

If an event is too small to read (if there are numerous events at one time), the user 
can click on the event and a dialog box will pop up with all of the information for that
event in it.
